# Tetris
In this homework, we develope a Java Tetris game and tested it with Gradle/JUnit. The Tetris code refers to ([Zetcode](https://zetcode.com/javagames/tetris/)).

### The assignment
The tests are currently failing because of an output mismatch. Fixing the `System.out.println` in the main method will make the tests green.

### Setup command
N/A

### Run command
`gradle test`

### Notes
- The JDK is installed on GitHub Actions machines, so you're also able to directly invoke `javac`, `java`, or any other CLI command included in the JDK.
